	help

	An emulator of the RTAI system.

	This emulator is actually broken beyond all recognition:
	- on MMU-less targets
	- on 64bit targets

	WARNING: This emulator is DEPRECATED. It is planned for
	removal in v2.6.x. Legacy applications depending on it should
	be converted to the native Xenomai API, which provides
	equivalent features, and more.

	int "Base period (us)" if XENO_OPT_TIMING_PERIODIC
	default 0
	help
	Duration of the base periodic tick (in microseconds).

	The RTAI skin can express all delays and timeouts either as
	counts of ticks (i.e. jiffy-based), or directly in
	nanoseconds in a tick-less fashion. This paramater defines the
	duration of the base period in microseconds; a null value
	selects the tick-less mode.

	The base period can be overriden at runtime using the
	"tick_arg" module parameter when loading the RTAI skin.

	If in doubt, leave zero in this field.

config XENO_OPT_RTAI_FIFO
	bool "Fifos"
	select XENO_OPT_PIPE
	default y
	help

	Fifos are uni-directional communication channels allowing data
	exchange between real-time tasks in kernel-space and regular
	user-space processes.

config XENO_OPT_RTAI_SEM
	bool "Semaphores"
	default y
	help

	Semaphores are synchronization objects granting RTAI
	tasks a concurrent access to a given number of resources.

config XENO_OPT_RTAI_SHM
	bool "Shared Memory"
	default y
	help

	SHM are Shared Memory objects across RTAI tasks.

Machining Center Overview
\layout Standard

This section gives a brief description of how a machining center is viewed
 from the input and output ends of the Interpreter.
 It is assumed the reader is already familiar with machining centers.
\layout Standard

Both the RS274/NGC
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{RS274NGC}

\end_inset 

 input language and the output canonical machining functions have a view
 of (1) mechanical components of a machining center being controlled and
 (2) what activities of the machining center may be controlled, and what
 data is used in control.
 
\layout Standard

The view here includes some items that a given machining center may not
 have, such as a pallet shuttle.
 The RS274/NGC language and canonical machining functions may be used with
 such a machine provided that no NC program used with the controller includes
 commands intended to activate physical capabilities the machine does not
 have.
 For such a machine, it would be useful to modify the Interpreter so it
 will reject input commands and will not produce output canonical function
 calls addressed to non-existent equipment.
 
\layout Section

Mechanical Components
\layout Standard

A machining center has many mechanical components that may be controlled
 or may affect the way in which control is exercised.
 This section describes the subset of those components that interact with
 the Interpreter.
 Mechanical components that do not interact directly with the Interpreter,
 such as the jog buttons, are not described here, even if they affect control.
 
\layout Subsection

Axes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{axes}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Any machining center has one or more Axes.
 Different types of machining centers have different combinations.
 For instance, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

4-axis milling machine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 may have XYZA or XYZB axes.
 A lathe typically has XZ axes.
 A foam-cutting machine may have XYUZ axes.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed false

\layout Standard

If the motion of mechanical components is not independent, as with hexapod
 machines, the RS274/NGC language and the canonical machining functions
 will still be usable, as long as the lower levels of control know how to
 control the actual mechanisms to produce the same relative motion of tool
 and workpiece as would be produced by independent axes.
 This is called 
\emph on 
kinematics
\emph default 
.
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

In EMC, the case of a XYYZ 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

gantry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 machine with two motors for one axis is better handled by kinematics rather
 than by a second linear axis.
\end_inset 


\layout Subsubsection

Primary Linear Axes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{axes, primary linear}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The X, Y, and Z axes produce linear motion in three mutually orthogonal
 directions
\layout Subsubsection

Secondary Linear Axes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{axes, secondary linear}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The U, V, and W axes produce linear motion in three mutually orthogonal
 directions.
 Typically, X and U are parallel, Y and V are parallel, and Z and W are
 parallel.
\layout Subsubsection

Rotational Axes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{axes, rotational}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The A, B and C axes produce angular motion (rotation).
 Typically, A rotates around a line parallel to X, B rotates around a line
 parallel to Y, and C rotates around a line parallel to Z.
\layout Subsection

Spindle
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{spindle}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A machining center has a spindle which holds one cutting tool, probe, or
 other item.
 The spindle can rotate in either direction, and it can be made to rotate
 at a constant rate, which may be changed.
 Except on machines where the spindle may be moved by moving a rotational
 axis, the axis of the spindle is kept parallel to the Z-axis and is coincident
 with the Z-axis when X and Y are zero.
 The spindle can be stopped in a fixed orientation or stopped without specifying
 orientation.
 
\layout Subsection

Coolant
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{coolant}

\layout Standard

A machining center has components to provide mist coolant and/or flood coolant.
\layout Subsection

Pallet Shuttle
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{pallet shuttle}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A machining center has a pallet shuttle system.
 The system has two movable pallets on which workpieces can be fixtured.
 Only one pallet at a time is in position for machining.
 
\layout Subsection

Tool Carousel
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{tool carousel}

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{spindle speed override}

\end_inset 

 Override Switches
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Feed-and-Speed}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A machining center has separate feed and speed override switches, which
 let the operator specify that the actual feed rate or spindle speed used
 in machining should be some percentage of the programmed rate.
 See Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Feed-Interaction}

\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Section

Control and Data Components
\layout Subsection

Linear Axes
\layout Standard

The X, Y, and Z axes form a standard right-handed coordinate system of orthogona
l linear axes.
 Positions of the three linear motion mechanisms are expressed using coordinates
 on these axes.
\layout Standard

The U, V and W axes also form a standard right-handed coordinate system.
 X and U are parallel, Y and V are parallel, and Z and W are parallel.
\layout Subsection

Rotational Axes
\layout Standard

The rotational axes are measured in degrees as wrapped linear axes in which
 the direction of positive rotation is counterclockwise when viewed from
 the positive end of the corresponding X, Y, or Z-axis.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

wrapped linear axis,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 we mean one on which the angular position increases without limit (goes
 towards plus infinity) as the axis turns counterclockwise and deceases
 without limit (goes towards minus infinity) as the axis turns clockwise.
 Wrapped linear axes are used regardless of whether or not there is a mechanical
 limit on rotation.
\layout Standard

Clockwise or counterclockwise is from the point of view of the workpiece.
 If the workpiece is fastened to a turntable which turns on a rotational
 axis, a counterclockwise turn from the point of view of the workpiece is
 accomplished by turning the turntable in a direction that (for most common
 machine configurations) looks clockwise from the point of view of someone
 standing next to the machine.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

If the parallelism requirement is violated, the system builder will have
 to say how to distinguish clockwise from counterclockwise.
\end_inset 


\layout Subsection

Controlled Point
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Controlled-Point}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{controlled point}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The controlled point is the point whose position and rate of motion are
 controlled.
 When the tool length offset is zero (the default value), this is a point
 on the spindle axis (often called the gauge point) that is some fixed distance
 beyond the end of the spindle, usually near the end of a tool holder that
 fits into the spindle.
 The location of the controlled point can be moved out along the spindle
 axis by specifying some positive amount for the tool length offset.
 This amount is normally the length of the cutting tool in use, so that
 the controlled point is at the end of the cutting tool.
 On a lathe, tool length offsets can be specified for X and Z axes, and
 the controlled point is either at the tool tip or slightly outside it (where
 the perpendicular, axis-aligned lines touched by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

front
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

side
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of the tool intersect).
\layout Subsection

Coordinated Linear Motion
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Coordinate-Linear-Motion}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

To drive a tool along a specified path, a machining center must often coordinate
 the motion of several axes.
 We use the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

coordinated linear motion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to describe the situation in which, nominally, each axis moves at constant
 speed and all axes move from their starting positions to their end positions
 at the same time.
 If only the X, Y, and Z axes (or any one or two of them) move, this produces
 motion in a straight line, hence the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

linear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the term.
 In actual motions, it is often not possible to maintain constant speed
 because acceleration or deceleration is required at the beginning and/or
 end of the motion.
 It is feasible, however, to control the axes so that, at all times, each
 axis has completed the same fraction of its required motion as the other
 axes.
 This moves the tool along same path, and we also call this kind of motion
 coordinated linear motion.
\layout Standard

Coordinated linear motion can be performed either at the prevailing feed
 rate, or at traverse rate, or it may be synchronized to the spindle rotation.
 If physical limits on axis speed make the desired rate unobtainable, all
 axes are slowed to maintain the desired path.
\layout Subsection

Feed Rate
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{feed rate}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Feed-Rate}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The rate at which the controlled point or the axes move is nominally a steady
 rate which may be set by the user.
 In the Interpreter, the interpretation of the feed rate is as follows unless
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

inverse time feed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

feed per revolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 modes are being used (see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:G93,-G94:-Set}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Enumerate

If any of XYZ are moving, F is in units per minute in the XYZ cartesian
 system, and all other axes (UVWABC) move so as to start and stop in coordinated
 fashion
\layout Enumerate

Otherwise, if any of UVW are moving, F is in units per minute in the UVW
 cartesian system, and all other axes (ABC) move so as to start and stop
 in coordinated fashion
\layout Enumerate

Otherwise, the move is pure rotary motion and the F word is in rotary units
 in the ABC 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

pseudo-cartesian
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 system.
\layout Subsection

Coolant
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{coolant}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Flood coolant and mist coolant may each be turned on independently.
 The RS274/NGC language turns them off together (see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:M7,-M8,-M9:}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Subsection

Dwell
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{dwell}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A machining center may be commanded to dwell (i.e., keep all axes unmoving)
 for a specific amount of time.
 The most common use of dwell is to break and clear chips, so the spindle
 is usually turning during a dwell.
 Regardless of the Path Control Mode (see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Path-Control-Mode}

\end_inset 

) the machine will stop exactly at the end of the previous programmed move,
 as though it was in exact path mode.
\layout Subsection

Units
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{units}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Units used for distances along the X, Y, and Z axes may be measured in millimete
rs or inches.
 Units for all other quantities involved in machine control cannot be changed.
 Different quantities use different specific units.
 Spindle speed is measured in revolutions per minute.
 The positions of rotational axes are measured in degrees.
 Feed rates are expressed in current length units per minute, or degrees
 per minute, or length units per spindle revolution, as described in Section
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Feed-Rate}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsection

Current Position
\layout Standard

The controlled point is always at some location called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

current position,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and the controller always knows where that is.
 The numbers representing the current position must be adjusted in the absence
 of any axis motion if any of several events take place:
\layout Enumerate

Length units are changed.
\layout Enumerate

Tool length offset is changed.
\layout Enumerate

Coordinate system offsets are changed.
 
\layout Subsection

Selected Plane
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Selected-Plane}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

There is always a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

selected plane
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, which must be the XY-plane, the YZ-plane, or the XZ-plane of the machining
 center.
 The Z-axis is, of course, perpendicular to the XY-plane, the X-axis to
 the YZ-plane, and the Y-axis to the XZ-plane.
 
\layout Subsection

Tool Carousel
\layout Standard

Zero or one tool is assigned to each slot in the tool carousel.
\layout Subsection

Tool Change
\layout Standard

A machining center may be commanded to change tools.
\layout Subsection

Pallet Shuttle
\layout Standard

The two pallets may be exchanged by command.
\layout Subsection

Feed and Speed Override Switches
\layout Standard

The feed and speed override switches may be enabled (so they work as expected)
 or disabled (so they have no effect on the feed rate or spindle speed).
 The RS274/NGC language has one command that enables both switches and one
 command that disables both (see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:M48,-M49:-Override}

\end_inset 

).
 See Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Feed-Interaction}

\end_inset 

 for further details.
 
\layout Subsection

Path Control Mode
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{path control mode}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Path-Control-Mode}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The machining center may be put into any one of three path control modes:
 (1) exact stop mode, (2) exact path mode, or (3) continuous mode with optional
 tolerance.
 In exact stop mode, the machine stops briefly at the end of each programmed
 move.
 In exact path mode, the machine follows the programmed path as exactly
 as possible, slowing or stopping if necessary at sharp corners of the path.
 In continuous mode, sharp corners of the path may be rounded slightly so
 that the feed rate may be kept up (but by no more than the tolerance, if
 specified).
 See Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:G61,-G61.1,-G64:}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Interpreter Interaction with Switches
\layout Standard

The Interpreter interacts with several switches.
 This section describes the interactions in more detail.
 In no case does the Interpreter know what the setting of any of these switches
 is.
 
\layout Subsection

Feed and Speed Override Switches
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Feed-Interaction}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The Interpreter will interpret RS274/NGC commands which enable (
\family typewriter 
M48
\family default 
) or disable (
\family typewriter 
M49
\family default 
) the feed and speed override switches.
 For certain moves, such as the traverse out of the end of a thread during
 a threading cycle, the switches are disabled automatically.
\layout Standard

EMC2 reacts to the speed and feed override settings when these switches
 are enabled.
\layout Subsection

Block Delete
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{block delete}

\end_inset 

 Switch
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Block-Delete-Switch-Interaction}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

If the block delete switch is on, lines of RS274/NGC code which start with
 a slash (the block delete character) are not interpreted.
 If the switch is off, such lines are interpreted.
 Normally the block delete switch should be set before starting the NGC
 program.
\layout Subsection

Optional Program Stop
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{optional program stop}

\end_inset 

 Switch
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Optional-Program-Stop-Interaction}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

If this switch is on and an M1 code is encountered, program execution is
 paused.
\layout Section

Tool File
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Tool-File}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A tool file is required to use the Interpreter.
 The file tells which tools are in which carousel slots and what the length
 and diameter of each tool are.
\layout Standard

The file consists of any number of header lines, followed by one blank line,
 followed by any number of lines of data.
 The header lines are ignored by the interpreter.
 It is important that there be exactly one blank line (with no spaces or
 tabs, even) before the data.
 The header line shown in Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Sample-Tool-File}

\end_inset 

 describes the data columns, so it is suggested (but not required) that
 such a line always be included in the header.
\layout Standard

Each data line of the file contains the data for one tool.
 The line may contain 4 or 5 elements (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

mill format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) or 8 or 9 elements (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

lathe format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

).
\layout Standard

The units used for the length and diameter are in machine units.
\layout Standard

The lines do not have to be in any particular order.
 Switching the order of lines has no effect unless the same slot number
 is used on two or more lines, which should not normally be done, in which
 case the data for only the last such line will be used.
 
\layout Standard

In emc, the location of the tool file is specified in the ini file.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:[EMCIO]-Section}

\end_inset 

 for more details.
\layout Standard

A tool file may have a mixture of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

mill format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

lathe format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 lines, though usually the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 (slot number) of the tool carousel slot in which the tool is placed.
 The entries in this column must all be different.
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

FMS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 column contains an unsigned integer which represents a code number for
 the tool.
 The user may use any code for any tool, as long as the codes are unsigned
 integers.
 This is typically the same as the pocket number.
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

TLO
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 column contains a real number which represents the tool length offset.
 This number will be used if tool length offsets are being used and this
 pocket is selected.
 This is normally a positive real number, but it may be zero or any other
 number if it is never to be used.
\layout Standard

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Diameter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 column contains a real number.
 This number is used only if tool radius compensation is turned on using
 this pocket.
 If the programmed path during compensation is the edge of the material
 being cut, this should be a positive real number representing the measured
 diameter of the tool.
 If the programmed path during compensation is the path of a tool whose
 diameter is nominal, this should be a small number (positive, negative,
 or zero) representing the difference between the measured diameter of the
 tool and the nominal diameter.
 If cutter radius compensation is not used with a tool, it does not matter
 what number is in this column.

In the RS274/NGC language view, a machining center maintains an array of
 5400 numerical parameters.
 Many of them have specific uses.
 The parameter array persists over time, even if the machining center is
 powered down.
 EMC2 uses a parameter file to ensure persistence and gives the Interpreter
 the responsibility for maintaining the file.
 The Interpreter reads the file when it starts up, and writes the file when
 it exits.

The format of a parameter file is shown in Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Parameter-File-Format}

\end_inset 

.
 The file consists of any number of header lines, followed by one blank
 line, followed by any number of lines of data.
 The Interpreter skips over the header lines.
 It is important that there be exactly one blank line (with no spaces or
 tabs, even) before the data.
 The header line shown in Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Parameter-File-Format}

\end_inset 

 describes the data columns, so it is suggested (but not required) that
 that line always be included in the header.
\layout Standard

The Interpreter reads only the first two columns of the table.
 The third column, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Comment,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is not read by the Interpreter.
\layout Standard

Each line of the file contains the index number of a parameter in the first
 column and the value to which that parameter should be set in the second
 column.
 The value is represented as a double-precision floating point number inside
 the Interpreter, but a decimal point is not required in the file.
 All of the parameters shown in Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Parameter-File-Format}

\end_inset 

 are required parameters and must be included in any parameter file, except
 that any parameter representing a rotational axis value for an unused axis
 may be omitted.
 An error will be signalled if any required parameter is missing.
 A parameter file may include any other parameter, as long as its number
 is in the range 1 to 5400.
 The parameter numbers must be arranged in ascending order.
 An error will be signalled if not.
 Any parameter included in the file read by the Interpreter will be included
 in the file it writes as it exits.
 The original file is saved as a backup file when the new file is written.
 Comments are not preserved when the file is written.

In the RS274/NGC language view, a machining center has an absolute coordinate
 system and nine program coordinate systems.
\layout Standard

You can set the offsets of the nine program coordinate systems using 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2 Pn
\family default 
 (n is the number of the coordinate system) with values for the axes in
 terms of the absolute coordinate system.
 See Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:G10:-Set-Coordinate}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

You can select one of the nine systems by using

 It is not possible to select the absolute coordinate system directly.
\layout Standard

You can offset the current coordinate system using 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
G92.3
\family default 
.
 This offset will then apply to all nine program coordinate systems.
 This offset may be cancelled with 
\family typewriter 
G92.1
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
G92.2
\family default 
.
 See Section

\layout Standard

Data for coordinate systems is stored in parameters.
\layout Standard

During initialization, the coordinate system is selected that is specified
 by parameter 5220.
 A value of 1 means the first coordinate system (the one

Language Overview
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{cha:Language-Overview}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The RS274/NGC language is based on lines of code.
 Each line (also called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

block
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) may include commands to a machining center to do several different things.
 Lines of code may be collected in a file to make a program.
\layout Standard

A typical line of code consists of an optional line number at the beginning
 followed by one or more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

words.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 A word consists of a letter followed by a number (or something that evaluates
 to a number).
 A word may either give a command or provide an argument to a command.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
G1 X3
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is a valid line of code with two words.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
G1
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is a command meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

move in a straight line at the programmed feed rate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
X3
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 provides an argument value (the value of X should be 3 at the end of the
 move).
 Most RS274/NGC commands start with either G or M (for General and Miscellaneous
).
 The words for these commands are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

G codes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

M codes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The RS274/NGC
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{RS274NGC}

\end_inset 

 language has no indicator for the start of a program.
 The Interpreter, however, deals with files.
 A single program may be in a single file, or a program may be spread across
 several files.
 A file may demarcated with percents in the following way.
 The first non-blank line of a file may contain nothing but a percent sign,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

%
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, possibly surrounded by white space, and later in the file (normally at
 the end of the file) there may be a similar line.
 Demarcating a file with percents is optional if the file has an 
\family typewriter 
M2
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
M30
\family default 
 in it, but is required if not.
 An error will be signalled if a file has a percent line at the beginning
 but not at the end.
 The useful contents of a file demarcated by percents stop after the second
 percent line.
 Anything after that is ignored.
\layout Standard

The RS274/NGC language has two commands (
\family typewriter 
M2
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
M30
\family default 
), either of which ends a program.
 A program may end before the end of a file.
 Lines of a file that occur after the end of a program are not to be executed.
 The interpreter does not even read them.
\layout Section

Format of a line
\layout Standard

A permissible line of input RS274/NGC code consists of the following, in
 order, with the restriction that there is a maximum (currently 256) to
 the number of characters allowed on a line.
\layout Enumerate

an optional block delete character, which is a slash 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 .
 
\layout Enumerate

an optional line number.
\layout Enumerate

any number of words, parameter settings, and comments.
\layout Enumerate

an end of line marker (carriage return or line feed or both).
 
\layout Standard

Any input not explicitly allowed is illegal and will cause the Interpreter
 to signal an error.
\layout Standard

Spaces and tabs are allowed anywhere on a line of code and do not change
 the meaning of the line, except inside comments.
 This makes some strange-looking input legal.
 The line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
g0x +0.
 12 34y 7
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
g0 x+0.1234 y7
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, for example.
\layout Standard

Blank lines are allowed in the input.
 They are to be ignored.
\layout Standard

Input is case insensitive, except in comments, i.e., any letter outside a
 comment may be in upper or lower case without changing the meaning of a
 line.
 
\layout Section

Line Number
\layout Standard

A line number is the letter N followed by an integer (with no sign) between
 0 and 99999 written with no more than five digits (000009 is not OK, for
 example).
 Line numbers may be repeated or used out of order, although normal practice
 is to avoid such usage.
 Line numbers may also be skipped, and that is normal practice.
 A line number is not required to be used, but must be in the proper place
 if used.
\layout Section

Word
\layout Standard

A word is a letter other than N followed by a real value.
\layout Standard

Words may begin with any of the letters shown in Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Words-and-their}

\end_inset 

.
 The table includes N for completeness, even though, as defined above, line
 numbers are not words.
 Several letters (I, J, K, L, P, R) may have different meanings in different
 contexts.
 Letters which refer to axis names are not valid on a machine which does
 not have the corresponding axis.

\layout Subsection

Number
\layout Standard

The following rules are used for (explicit) numbers.
 In these rules a digit is a single character between 0 and 9.
\layout Itemize

A number consists of (1) an optional plus or minus sign, followed by (2)
 zero to many digits, followed, possibly, by (3) one decimal point, followed
 by (4) zero to many digits - provided that there is at least one digit
 somewhere in the number.
\layout Itemize

There are two kinds of numbers: integers and decimals.
 An integer does not have a decimal point in it; a decimal does.
\layout Itemize

Numbers may have any number of digits, subject to the limitation on line
 length.
 Only about seventeen significant figures will be retained, however (enough
 for all known applications).
\layout Itemize

A non-zero number with no sign as the first character is assumed to be positive.
\layout Standard

Notice that initial (before the decimal point and the first non-zero digit)
 and trailing (after the decimal point and the last non-zero digit) zeros
 are allowed but not required.
 A number written with initial or trailing zeros will have the same value
 when it is read as if the extra zeros were not there.
\layout Standard

Numbers used for specific purposes in RS274/NGC are often restricted to
 some finite set of values or some to some range of values.
 In many uses, decimal numbers must be close to integers; this includes
 the values of indexes (for parameters and carousel slot numbers, for example),
 M codes, and G codes multiplied by ten.
 A decimal number which is supposed be close to an integer is considered
 close enough if it is within 0.0001 of an integer.
 
\layout Subsection

Parameter Value
\layout Standard

A parameter value is the pound character 
\family typewriter 
#
\family default 
 followed by a real value.
 The real value must evaluate to an integer between 1 and 5399.
 The integer is a parameter number, and the value of the parameter value
 is whatever number is stored in the numbered parameter.
\layout Standard

The 
\family typewriter 
#
\family default 
 character takes precedence over other operations, so that, for example,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#1+2
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 means the number found by adding 2 to the value of parameter 1, not the
 value found in parameter 3.
 Of course, 
\family typewriter 
#[1+2]
\family default 
 does mean the value found in parameter 3.
 The 
\family typewriter 
#
\family default 
 character may be repeated; for example 
\family typewriter 
##2
\family default 
 means the value of the parameter whose index is the (integer) value of
 parameter 2.
 
\layout Subsection

Expressions and Binary Operations
\layout Standard

An expression is a set of characters starting with a left bracket 
\family typewriter 
[
\family default 
 and ending with a balancing right bracket 
\family typewriter 
]
\family default 
.
 In between the brackets are numbers, parameter values, mathematical operations,
 and other expressions.
 An expression may be evaluated to produce a number.
 The expressions on a line are evaluated when the line is read, before anything
 on the line is executed.
 An example of an expression is 
\family typewriter 
[ 1 + acos[0] - [#3 ** [4.0/2]]]
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

Binary operations appear only inside expressions.
 There are four basic mathematical operations: addition (
\family typewriter 
+
\family default 
), subtraction (
\family typewriter 
-
\family default 
), multiplication (
\family typewriter 
*
\family default 
), and division (
\family typewriter 
/
\family default 
).
 There are three logical operations: non-exclusive or (
\family typewriter 
OR
\family default 
), exclusive or (
\family typewriter 
XOR
\family default 
), and logical and (
\family typewriter 
AND
\family default 
).
 The eighth operation is the modulus operation (
\family typewriter 
MOD
\family default 
).
 The ninth operation is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 operation (
\family typewriter 
**
\family default 
) of raising the number on the left of the operation to the power on the
 right.
 The relational operators are equality (
\family typewriter 
EQ
\family default 
), inequality (
\family typewriter 
NE
\family default 
), strictly greater than (
\family typewriter 
GT
\family default 
), greater than or equal to (
\family typewriter 
GE
\family default 
), strictly less than (
\family typewriter 
LT
\family default 
), and less than or equal to (
\family typewriter 
LE
\family default 
).
\layout Standard

The binary operations are divided into three groups.
 The first group is: power.
 The second group is: multiplication, division, and modulus.
 The third group is: addition, subtraction, logical non-exclusive or, logical
 exclusive or, and logical and.
 If operations are strung together (for example in the expression 
\family typewriter 
[2.0 / 3 * 1.5 - 5.5 / 11.0]
\family default 
), operations in the first group are to be performed before operations in
 the second group and operations in the second group before operations in
 the third group.
 If an expression contains more than one operation from the same group (such
 as the first 
\family typewriter 
/
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
*
\family default 
 in the example), the operation on the left is performed first.
 Thus, the example is equivalent to: 
\family typewriter 
[((2.0 / 3) * 1.5) - (5.5 / 11.0)]
\family default 
 , which simplifies to 
\family typewriter 
[1.0 - 0.5]
\family default 
 , which is 
\family typewriter 
0.5
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

The logical operations and modulus are to be performed on any real numbers,
 not just on integers.
 The number zero is equivalent to logical false, and any non-zero number
 is equivalent to logical true.
 
\layout Subsection

Unary Operation Value
\layout Standard

A unary operation value is either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
ATAN
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 followed by one expression divided by another expression (for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
ATAN[2]/[1+3]
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) or any other unary operation name followed by an expression (for example
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
SIN[90]
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

).
 The unary operations are: 
\family typewriter 
ABS
\family default 
 (absolute value), 
\family typewriter 
ACOS
\family default 
 (arc cosine), 
\family typewriter 
ASIN
\family default 
 (arc sine), 
\family typewriter 
ATAN
\family default 
 (arc tangent), 
\family typewriter 
COS
\family default 
 (cosine), 
\family typewriter 
EXP
\family default 
 (e raised to the given power), 
\family typewriter 
FIX
\family default 
 (round down), 
\family typewriter 
FUP
\family default 
 (round up), 
\family typewriter 
LN
\family default 
 (natural logarithm), 
\family typewriter 
ROUND
\family default 
 (round to the nearest whole number), 
\family typewriter 
SIN
\family default 
 (sine), 
\family typewriter 
SQRT
\family default 
 (square root), and 
\family typewriter 
TAN
\family default 
 (tangent).
 Arguments to unary operations which take angle measures (
\family typewriter 
COS
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
SIN
\family default 
, and 
\family typewriter 
TAN
\family default 
) are in degrees.
 Values returned by unary operations which return angle measures (
\family typewriter 
ACOS
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
ASIN
\family default 
, and 
\family typewriter 
ATAN
\family default 
) are also in degrees.
\layout Standard

The 
\family typewriter 
FIX
\family default 
 operation rounds towards the left (less positive or more negative) on a
 number line, so that 
\family typewriter 
FIX[2.8] =2
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
FIX[-2.8] = -3
\family default 
, for example.
 The 
\family typewriter 
FUP
\family default 
 operation rounds towards the right (more positive or less negative) on
 a number line; 
\family typewriter 
FUP[2.8] = 3
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
FUP[-2.8] = -2
\family default 
, for example.
 
\layout Section

Parameter Setting
\layout Standard

A parameter setting is the following four items one after the other: (1)
 a pound character # , (2) a real value which evaluates to an integer between
 1 and 5399, (3) an equal sign = , and (4) a real value.
 For example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3 = 15
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is a parameter setting meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

set parameter 3 to 15.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A parameter setting does not take effect until after all parameter values
 on the same line have been found.
 For example, if parameter 3 has been previously set to 15 and the line
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3=6 G1 x#3
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is interpreted, a straight move to a point where x equals 15 will occur
 and the value of parameter 3 will be 6.
 
\layout Section

Comments and Messages
\layout Standard

Printable characters and white space inside parentheses is a comment.
 A left parenthesis always starts a comment.
 The comment ends at the first right parenthesis found thereafter.
 Once a left parenthesis is placed on a line, a matching right parenthesis
 must appear before the end of the line.
 Comments may not be nested; it is an error if a left parenthesis is found
 after the start of a comment and before the end of the comment.
 Here is an example of a line containing a comment: 
\family typewriter 

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

G80 M5 (stop motion)
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Comments do not cause a machining center to do anything.
\layout Standard

A comment contains a message if 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
MSG,
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 appears after the left parenthesis and before any other printing characters.
 Variants of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
MSG,
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which include white space and lower case characters are allowed.
 The rest of the characters before the right parenthesis are considered
 to be a message.
 Messages should be displayed on the message display device.
 Comments not containing messages need not be displayed there.
 
\layout Standard

A comment can also be used to specify a file for the results of G38.2 probing.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:G38.2:-Straight-Probe}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Repeated Items
\layout Standard

A line may have any number of G words, but two G words from the same modal
 group (see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Modal-Groups}

\end_inset 

) may not appear on the same line.
\layout Standard

A line may have zero to four M words.
 Two M words from the same modal group may not appear on the same line.
\layout Standard

For all other legal letters, a line may have only one word beginning with
 that letter.
\layout Standard

If a parameter setting of the same parameter is repeated on a line, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3=15 #3=6
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, for example, only the last setting will take effect.
 It is silly, but not illegal, to set the same parameter twice on the same
 line.
\layout Standard

If more than one comment appears on a line, only the last one will be used;
 each of the other comments will be read and its format will be checked,
 but it will be ignored thereafter.
 It is expected that putting more than one comment on a line will be very
 rare.
 
\layout Section

Item order
\layout Standard

The three types of item whose order may vary on a line (as given at the
 beginning of this section) are word, parameter setting, and comment.
 Imagine that these three types of item are divided into three groups by
 type.
\layout Standard

The first group (the words) may be reordered in any way without changing
 the meaning of the line.
\layout Standard

If the second group (the parameter settings) is reordered, there will be
 no change in the meaning of the line unless the same parameter is set more
 than once.
 In this case, only the last setting of the parameter will take effect.
 For example, after the line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3=15 #3=6
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 has been interpreted, the value of parameter 3 will be 6.
 If the order is reversed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#3=6 #3=15
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and the line is interpreted, the value of parameter 3 will be 15.
\layout Standard

If the third group (the comments) contains more than one comment and is
 reordered, only the last comment will be used.
\layout Standard

If each group is kept in order or reordered without changing the meaning
 of the line, then the three groups may be interleaved in any way without
 changing the meaning of the line.
 For example, the line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
g40 g1 #3=15 (foo) #4=-7.0
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 has five items and means exactly the same thing in any of the 120 possible
 orders (such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
#4=-7.0 g1 #3=15 g40 (foo)
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) for the five items.
 
\layout Section

Commands and Machine Modes
\layout Standard

In RS274/NGC, many commands cause a machining center to change from one
 mode to another, and the mode stays active until some other command changes
 it implicitly or explicitly.
 Such commands are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

modal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 For example, if coolant is turned on, it stays on until it is explicitly
 turned off.
 The G codes for motion are also modal.
 If a G1 (straight move) command is given on one line, for example, it will
 be executed again on the next line if one or more axis words is available
 on the line, unless an explicit command is given on that next line using
 the axis words or cancelling motion.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Non-modal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 codes have effect only on the lines on which they occur.
 For example, G4 (dwell) is non-modal.
 
\layout Section

Modal Groups
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Modal-Groups}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Modal commands are arranged in sets called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

modal groups
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, and only one member of a modal group may be in force at any given time.
 In general, a modal group contains commands for which it is logically impossibl
e for two members to be in effect at the same time - like measure in inches
 vs.
 measure in millimeters.
 A machining center may be in many modes at the same time, with one mode
 from each modal group being in effect.
 The modal groups are shown in Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Modal-Groups}

For several modal groups, when a machining center is ready to accept commands,
 one member of the group must be in effect.
 There are default settings for these modal groups.
 When the machining center is turned on or otherwise re-initialized, the
 default values are automatically in effect.
\layout Standard

Group 1, the first group on the table, is a group of G codes for motion.
 One of these is always in effect.
 That one is called the current motion mode.
\layout Standard

It is an error to put a G-code from group 1 and a G-code from group 0 on
 the same line if both of them use axis words.
 If an axis word-using G-code from group 1 is implicitly in effect on a
 line (by having been activated on an earlier line), and a group 0 G-code
 that uses axis words appears on the line, the activity of the group 1 G-code
 is suspended for that line.
 The axis word-using G-codes from group 0 are G10, G28, G30, and G92.

In the command prototypes, the hypen (
\family typewriter

 As described earlier, a real value may be (1) an explicit number, 
\family typewriter

\family default 
, for example, (2) an expression, 
\family typewriter 
[2+2]
\family default 
, for example, (3) a parameter value,

) are given, they specify a destination point.
 Axis numbers are in the currently active coordinate system, unless explicitly
 described as being in the absolute coordinate system.
 Where axis words are optional, any omitted axes will have their current
 value.
 Any items in the command prototypes not explicitly described as optional
 are required.
 It is an error if a required item is omitted.
 In prototypes, this will be written as 
\family typewriter 
\emph on 
axes
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

In the prototypes, the values following letters are often given as explicit
 numbers.
 Unless stated otherwise, the explicit numbers can be real values.
 For example, 
\family typewriter 
G10 L2
\family default 
 could equally well be written 
\family typewriter 
G[2*5] L[1+1]
\family default 
.
 If the value of parameter 100 were 2, 
\family typewriter 
G10 L#100
\family default 
 would also mean the same.
 Using real values which are not explicit numbers as just shown in the examples
 is rarely useful.

\layout Standard

A circular or helical arc is specified using either 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
 (clockwise arc) or 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 (counterclockwise arc).
 The axis of the circle or helix must be parallel to the X, Y, or Z-axis

 If the arc is circular, it lies in a plane parallel to the selected plane.
\layout Standard

If a line of RS274/NGC code makes an arc and includes rotational axis motion,
 the rotational axes turn at a constant rate so that the rotational motion
 starts and finishes when the XYZ motion starts and finishes.

Two formats are allowed for specifying an arc: Center Format and Radius
 Format.
\layout Subsection

Center format arcs (preferred format)
\layout Standard

In the center format, the coordinates of the end point of the arc in the
 selected plane are specified along with the offsets of the center of the
 arc from the current location.
 In this format, it is OK if the end point of the arc is the same as the
 current point.
 It is an error if:
\layout Itemize

When the arc is projected on the selected plane, the distance from the current
 point to the center differs from the distance from the end point to the
 center by more than 0.0002 inch (if inches are being used) or 0.002 millimeter
 (if millimeters are being used).
\layout Standard

When the XY-plane is selected, program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 I- J-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
).
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of X and Y must
 be used.
 I and J are the offsets from the current location (in the X and Y directions,
 respectively) of the center of the circle.
 I and J are optional except that at least one of the two must be used.
 It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

X and Y are both omitted
\layout Itemize

or I and J are both omitted.
\layout Standard

When the XZ-plane is selected, program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 I- K-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter

\family default 
).
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of X and Z must
 be used.
 I and K are the offsets from the current location (in the X and Z directions,
 respectively) of the center of the circle.
 I and K are optional except that at least one of the two must be used.
 It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

X and Z are both omitted, 
\layout Itemize

or I and K are both omitted.
\layout Standard

When the YZ-plane is selected, program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 J- K-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
).
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of Y and Z must
 be used.

\layout Standard

Here is an example of a center format command to mill an arc: 
\family typewriter 
G17 G2 x10 y16 i3 j4 z9
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

That means to make a clockwise (as viewed from the positive z-axis) circular
 or helical arc whose axis is parallel to the Z-axis, ending where X=10,
 Y=16, and Z=9, with its center offset in the X direction by 3 units from
 the current X location and offset in the Y direction by 4 units from the
 current Y location.
 If the current location has X=7, Y=7 at the outset, the center will be
 at X=10, Y=11.
 If the starting value of Z is 9, this is a circular arc; otherwise it is
 a helical arc.
 The radius of this arc would be 5.
\layout Standard

In the center format, the radius of the arc is not specified, but it may
 be found easily as the distance from the center of the circle to either
 the current point or the end point of the arc.
 
\layout Subsection

Radius format arcs (discouraged format)
\layout Standard

In the radius format, the coordinates of the end point of the arc in the
 selected plane are specified along with the radius of the arc.
 Program 
\family typewriter 
G2 
\emph on 
axes
\emph default 
 R-
\family default 
 (or use 
\family typewriter 
G3
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
G2
\family default 
).
 R is the radius.
 The axis words are all optional except that at least one of the two words
 for the axes in the selected plane must be used.
 The R number is the radius.
 A positive radius indicates that the arc turns through less than 180 degrees,
 while a negative radius indicates a turn of more than 180 degrees.
 If the arc is helical, the value of the end point of the arc on the coordinate
 axis parallel to the axis of the helix is also specified.
\layout Standard

It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

both of the axis words for the axes of the selected plane are omitted
\layout Itemize

the end point of the arc is the same as the current point.
\layout Standard

It is not good practice to program radius format arcs that are nearly full
 circles or nearly semicircles because a small change in the location of
 the end point will produce a much larger change in the location of the
 center of the circle (and, hence, the middle of the arc).
 The magnification effect is large enough that rounding error in a number
 can produce out-of-tolerance cuts.
 For instance, a 1% displacement of the endpoint of a 180 degree arc produced
 a 7% displacement of the point 90 degrees along the arc.
 Nearly full circles are even worse.
 Other size arcs (in the range tiny to 165 degrees or 195 to 345 degrees)
 are OK.
\layout Standard

Here is an example of a radius format command to mill an arc:
\family typewriter 
 G17 G2 x 10 y 15 r 20 z 5.
\layout Standard

That means to make a clockwise (as viewed from the positive Z-axis) circular
 or helical arc whose axis is parallel to the Z-axis, ending where X=10,
 Y=15, and Z=5, with a radius of 20.
 If the starting value of Z is 5, this is an arc of a circle parallel to
 the XY-plane; otherwise it is a helical arc.

\layout Standard

Unless using an exit taper, the exit move (traverse to original X) is not
 synchronized to the spindle speed.
 With a slow spindle, the exit move might take only a small fraction of
 a revolution.
 If the spindle speed is increased after several passes are complete, subsequent
 exit moves will require a larger portion of a revolution, resulting in
 a very heavy cut during the exit move.
 This can be avoided by providing a relief groove at the exit, or by not
 changing the spindle speed while threading.

: Canned Cycles
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:G81-to-G89:}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The canned cycles 
\family typewriter 
G81
\family default 
 through 
\family typewriter 
G89
\family default 
 have been implemented as described in this section.
 Two examples are given with the description of 
\family typewriter 
G81
\family default 
 below.
\layout Standard

All canned cycles are performed with respect to the currently selected plane.
 Any of the three planes (XY, YZ, ZX) may be selected.
 Throughout this section, most of the descriptions assume the XY-plane has
 been selected.
 The behavior is always analogous if the YZ or XZ-plane is selected.
\layout Standard

Rotational axis words are allowed in canned cycles, but it is better to
 omit them.
 If rotational axis words are used, the numbers must be the same as the
 current position numbers so that the rotational axes do not move.
\layout Standard

All canned cycles use X, Y, R, and Z numbers in the NC code.
 These numbers are used to determine X, Y, R, and Z positions.
 The R (usually meaning retract) position is along the axis perpendicular
 to the currently selected plane (Z-axis for XY-plane, X-axis for YZ-plane,
 Y-axis for XZ-plane).
 Some canned cycles use additional arguments.
\layout Standard

For canned cycles, we will call a number 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

sticky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 if, when the same cycle is used on several lines of code in a row, the
 number must be used the first time, but is optional on the rest of the
 lines.
 Sticky numbers keep their value on the rest of the lines if they are not
 explicitly programmed to be different.
 The R number is always sticky.
\layout Standard

In incremental distance mode: when the XY-plane is selected, X, Y, and R
 numbers are treated as increments to the current position and Z as an increment
 from the Z-axis position before the move involving Z takes place; when
 the YZ or XZ-plane is selected, treatment of the axis words is analogous.
 In absolute distance mode, the X, Y, R, and Z numbers are absolute positions
 in the current coordinate system.
\layout Standard

The L number is optional and represents the number of repeats.
 
\begin_inset Formula $L=0$
\end_inset 

 is not allowed.
 If the repeat feature is used, it is normally used in incremental distance
 mode, so that the same sequence of motions is repeated in several equally
 spaced places along a straight line.
 In absolute distance mode, 
\begin_inset Formula $L>1$
\end_inset 

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

do the same cycle in the same place several times,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Omitting the L word is equivalent to specifying 
\begin_inset Formula $L=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The L number is not sticky.
\layout Standard

When 
\begin_inset Formula $L>1$
\end_inset 

 in incremental mode with the XY-plane selected, the X and Y positions are
 determined by adding the given X and Y numbers either to the current X
 and Y positions (on the first go-around) or to the X and Y positions at
 the end of the previous go-around (on the repetitions).
 The R and Z positions do not change during the repeats.
\layout Standard

The height of the retract move at the end of each repeat (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

clear Z
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the descriptions below) is determined by the setting of the retract
 mode: either to the original Z position (if that is above the R position
 and the retract mode is 
\family typewriter 
G98
\family default 
, OLD_Z), or otherwise to the R position.
 See Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:G98,-G99:-Set}

\end_inset

\layout Itemize

X, Y, and Z words are all missing during a canned cycle,

\layout Standard

When the XY plane is active, the Z number is sticky, and it is an error
 if: 
\layout Itemize

the Z number is missing and the same canned cycle was not already active,
 
\layout Itemize

or the R number is less than the Z number.
\layout Standard

When the XZ plane is active, the Y number is sticky, and it is an error
 if: 
\layout Itemize

the Y number is missing and the same canned cycle was not already active,
 
\layout Itemize

or the R number is less than the Y number.
\layout Standard

When the YZ plane is active, the X number is sticky, and it is an error
 if: 
\layout Itemize

the X number is missing and the same canned cycle was not already active,
 
\layout Itemize

or the R number is less than the X number.
\layout Subsection

Preliminary and In-Between Motion
\layout Standard

At the very beginning of the execution of any of the canned cycles, with
 the XY-plane selected, if the current Z position is below the R position,
 the Z-axis is traversed to the R position.
 This happens only once, regardless of the value of L.
\layout Standard

In addition, at the beginning of the first cycle and each repeat, the following
 one or two moves are made
\layout Enumerate

a straight traverse parallel to the XY-plane to the given XY-position, 
\layout Enumerate

a straight traverse of the Z-axis only to the R position, if it is not already
 at the R position.
 
\layout Standard

If the XZ or YZ plane is active, the preliminary and in-between motions
 are analogous.

 In addition, parameters 5211 to 5216 are set to the X, Y, Z, A, B, and
 C-axis offsets.
 The offset for an axis is the amount the origin must be moved so that the
 coordinate of the controlled point on the axis has the specified value.
\layout Standard

Here is an example.
 Suppose the current point is at X=4 in the currently specified coordinate
 system and the current X-axis offset is zero, then 
\family typewriter 
G92 x7
\family default 
 sets the X-axis offset to -3, sets parameter 5211 to -3, and causes the
 X-coordinate of the current point to be 7.
\layout Standard

The axis offsets are always used when motion is specified in absolute distance
 mode using any of the nine coordinate systems (those designated by 
\family typewriter 
G54
\family default 
 - 
\family typewriter 
G59.3
\family default 
).
 Thus all nine coordinate systems are affected by 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

Being in incremental distance mode has no effect on the action of 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

Non-zero offsets may be already be in effect when the 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 is called.
 If this is the case, the new value of each offset is A+B, where A is what
 the offset would be if the old offset were zero, and B is the old offset.
 For example, after the previous example, the X-value of the current point
 is 7.
 If 
\family typewriter 
G92 x9
\family default 
 is then programmed, the new X-axis offset is -5, which is calculated by
 
\family typewriter 
[[7-9] + -3]
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

To reset axis offsets to zero, program 
\family typewriter 
G92.1
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
G92.2
\family default 
.
 
\family typewriter 
G92.1
\family default 
 sets parameters 5211 to 5216 to zero, whereas 
\family typewriter 
G92.2
\family default 
 leaves their current values alone.
\layout Standard

To set the axis offset values to the values given in parameters 5211 to
 5216, program 
\family typewriter 
G92.3
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

You can set axis offsets in one program and use the same offsets in another
 program.
 Program 
\family typewriter 
G92
\family default 
 in the first program.
 This will set parameters 5211 to 5216.
 Do not use 
\family typewriter 
G92.1
\family default 
 in the remainder of the first program.
 The parameter values will be saved when the first program exits and restored
 when the second one starts up.
 Use 
\family typewriter 
G92.3
\family default 
 near the beginning of the second program.
 That will restore the offsets saved in the first program.
 If other programs are to run between the the program that sets the offsets
 and the one that restores them, make a copy of the parameter file written
 by the first program and use it as the parameter file for the second program.

\layout Standard

In units per minute feed rate mode, an F word is interpreted to mean the
 controlled point should move at a certain number of inches per minute,
 millimeters per minute, or degrees per minute, depending upon what length
 units are being used and which axis or axes are moving.
\layout Standard

In units per revolution mode, an F word is interpreted to mean the controlled
 point should move a certain number of inches per revolution of the spindle,
 depending on what length units are being used and which axis or axes are
 moving.
\layout Standard

In inverse time feed rate mode, an F word means the move should be completed
 in [one divided by the F number] minutes.
 For example, if the F number is 2.0, the move should be completed in half
 a minute.
\layout Standard

When the inverse time feed rate mode is active, an F word must appear on
 every line which has a G1, G2, or G3 motion, and an F word on a line that
 does not have G1, G2, or G3 is ignored.
 Being in inverse time feed rate mode does not affect G0 (rapid traverse)
 motions.

 The spindle will turn at that speed when it has been programmed to start
 turning.
 It is OK to program an S word whether the spindle is turning or not.
 If the speed override switch is enabled and not set at 100%, the speed
 will be different from what is programmed.
 It is OK to program S0; the spindle will not turn if that is done.
 It is an error if: 
\layout Itemize

the S number is negative.
\layout Standard

As described in Section

T: Select Tool
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:T:-Select-Tool}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

To select a tool, program 
\family typewriter 
T-
\family default 
, where the T number is the carousel slot for the tool.
 The tool is not changed until an 
\family typewriter 
M6
\family default 
 is programmed (see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:M6:-Tool-Change}

\end_inset 

).
 The T word may appear on the same line as the 
\family typewriter 
M6
\family default 
 or on a previous line.
 It is OK, but not normally useful, if T words appear on two or more lines
 with no tool change.
 The carousel may move a lot, but only the most recent T word will take
 effect at the next tool change.
 It is OK to program 
\family typewriter 
T0
\family default 
; no tool will be selected.
 This is useful if you want the spindle to be empty after a tool change.
 It is an error if:
\layout Itemize

a negative T number is used, 
\layout Itemize

or a T number larger than the number of slots in the carousel is used.
\layout Standard

On some machines, the carousel will move when a T word is programmed, at
 the same time machining is occurring.
 On such machines, programming the T word several lines before a tool change
 will save time.
 A common programming practice for such machines is to put the T word for
 the next tool to be used on the line after a tool change.
 This maximizes the time available for the carousel to move.

G-Code Best Practices
\layout Section

Use an appropriate decimal precision
\layout Standard

Use at least 3 digits after the decimal when milling in millimeters, and
 at least 4 digits after the decimal when milling in inches.
 In particular, arc tolerance checks are made to .001 and .0001 depending
 on the active units.
\layout Section

Use consistent white space
\layout Standard

G-code is most legible when at least one space appears before words.
 While it is permitted to insert whitespace in the middle of numbers, there
 is no reason to do so.
\layout Section

Prefer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Center-format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 arcs
\layout Standard

Center-format arcs (which use 
\family typewriter 
I- J- K-
\family default 
 instead of 
\family typewriter 
R-
\family default 
) behave more consistently than R-format arcs, particularly for included
 angles near 180 or 360 degrees.
\layout Section

Put important modal settings at the top of the file
\layout Standard

When correct execution of your program depends on modal settings, be sure
 to set them at the beginning of the part program.
 Modes can carry over from previous programs and from the MDI commands.
\layout Standard

As a good preventative measure, put a line similar to the following at the
 top of all your programs:
\layout LyX-Code

G17 G20 G40 G49 G54 G80 G90 G94 
\layout Standard

(XY plane, inch mode, cancel diameter compensation, cancel length offset,
 coordinate system 1, cancel motion, non-incremental motion, feed/minute
 mode)
\layout Standard

Perhaps the most critical modal setting is the distance units--If you do
 not include G20 or G21, then different machines will mill the program at
 different scales.
 Other settings, such as the return mode in canned cycles may also be important.
\layout Section

Don't put too many things on one line
\layout Standard

Ignore everything in Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Order-of-Execution}

\end_inset 

, and instead write no line of code that is the slightest bit ambiguous.
 Similarly, don't use and set a parameter on the same line, even though
 the semantics are well defined.
 (Exception: Updating a variable to a new value, such as 
\family typewriter 
#1=[#1+#2
\family default 
])
\layout Section

Don't use line numbers
\layout Standard

Line numbers offer no benefits.
 When line numbers are reported in error messages, the numbers refer to
 the line number in the file, not the N-word value.
\layout Section

When moving more than one coordinate system, consider inverse time feed
 mode
\layout Standard

Because the meaning of an F-word in feed-per-minute mode varies depending
 on which axes are commanded to move, and because the amount of material
 removed does not depend only on the feed rate, it may be easier to use
 G93 inverse time feed mode to achieve the desired material removal rate.

Differences between EMC2 gcode and RS274NGC
\layout Section

Differences that change the meaning of well-formed RS274NGC programs
\layout Subsection

Location after a tool change
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the machine does not return to its original position after a tool
 change.
 This change was made because the new tool might be longer than the old
 tool, and the move to the original machine position could therefore leave
 the tool tip too low.
\layout Subsection

Offset parameters are inifile units
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the values stored in parameters for the G28 and G30 home locations,
 the P1\SpecialChar \ldots{}
P9 coordinate systems, and the G92 offset are in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

inifile units
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 This change was made because otherwise the meaning of a location changed
 depending on whether G20 or G21 was active when G28, G30, G10 L2, or G92.3
 is programmed.
\layout Subsection

Tool table lengths/diameters are in inifile units
\layout Standard

In EMC2, the tool lengths (offsets) and diameters in the tool table are
 specified in inifile units only.
 This change was made because otherwise the length of a tool and its diameter
 would change based on whether G20 or G21 was active when initiating G43,
 G41, G42 modes.
 This made it impossible to run gcode in the machine's non-native units,
 even when the gcode was simple and well-formed (starting with G20 or G21,
 and didn't change units throughout the program), without changing the tool
 table.
\layout Subsection

G84, G87 not implemented
\layout Standard

G84 and G87 are not currently implemented, but may be added to a future
 release of emc2.
\layout Subsection

G28, G30 with axis words
\layout Standard

When 
\family typewriter 
G28
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
G30
\family default 
 is programmed with only some axis words present, EMC2 only moves the named
 axes.
 This is common on other machine controls.
 To move some axes to an intermediate point and then move all axes to the
 predefined point, write two lines of gcode:
\layout LyX-Code

G0 X- Y- (axes to move to intermediate point)
\newline 
G28 (move all axes to predefined point)
\layout Subsection

M62, M63 not implemented

M62 and M63 are not currently implemented, but may be added to a future
 release of emc2.

Negative Tool Lengths
\layout Standard

The RS274NGC spec says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

it is expected that
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 all tool lengths will be positive.
 However, G43 works for negative tool lengths.
\layout Subsubsection

Lathe tools
\layout Standard

G43 tool length compensation can offset the tool in both the X and Z dimensions.
 This feature is primarily useful on lathes.
\layout Subsubsection

Dynamic tool lengths
\layout Standard

EMC2 allows specification of a computed tool length through 
\family typewriter 
G43.1 I K.
\layout Subsection

G41.1, G42.1
\layout Standard

EMC2 allows specification of a tool diameter and, if in lathe mode, orientation
 in the gcode.
 The format is 
\family typewriter 
G41.1/G42.1 D L
\family default 
, where 
\family typewriter 
D
\family default 
 is diameter and 
\family typewriter 
L
\family default 
 (if specified) is the lathe tool orientation.
\layout Subsection

G43 without H word
\layout Standard

In ngc, this is not allowed.
 In EMC2, it sets length offsets for the currently loaded tool.
 If no tool is currently loaded, it is an error.
 This change was made so the user doesn't have to specify the tool number
 in two places for each tool change, and because it's consistent with the
 way 
\family typewriter 
G41/G42
\family default 
 work when the 
\family typewriter 
D

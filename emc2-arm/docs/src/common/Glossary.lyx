\layout Standard

A listing of terms and what they mean.
 Some terms have a general meaning and several additional meanings for users,
 installers, and developers.
 
\begin_inset Note
collapsed true

\layout Standard

This pattern uses the Description paragraph style
\layout Standard

rather than the standard style.
\layout Standard

It also uses each term as a Label so that one term can
\layout Standard

easily refer to another using a cross reference.
\layout Standard

Cross references need a space ahead and after
\layout Standard

so that they look good in the published documents.

\layout Description

Acme\SpecialChar ~
Screw
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{acme screw}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{AcmeScrew}

\end_inset 

 A type of lead-screw 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Leadscrew}

\end_inset 

 that uses an acme thread form.
 Acme threads have somewhat lower friction and wear than simple triangular
 threads, but ball-screws 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Ballscrew}

\end_inset 

 are lower yet.
 Most manual machine tools use acme lead-screws.
\layout Description

Axis
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{axis}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{Axis}

\end_inset 

 One of the computer control movable parts of the machine.
 For a typical vertical mill, the table is the X axis, the saddle is the
 Y axis, and the quill or knee is the Z axis.
 Additional linear axes parallel to X, Y, and Z are called U, V, and W respectiv
ely.
 Angular axes like rotary tables are referred to as A, B, and C.
\layout Description

Backlash
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{backlash}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{Backlash}

\end_inset 

 The amount of "play" or lost motion that occurs when direction is reversed
 in a lead screw 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Leadscrew}

\end_inset 

.
 or other mechanical motion driving system.
 It can result from nuts that are loose on leadscrews, slippage in belts,
 cable slack, "wind-up" in rotary couplings, and other places where the
 mechanical system is not "tight".
 Backlash will result in inaccurate motion, or in the case of motion caused
 by external forces (think cutting tool pulling on the work piece) the result
 can be broken cutting tools.
 This can happen because of the sudden increase in chip load on the cutter
 as the work piece is pulled across the backlash distance by the cutting
 tool.
 
\layout Description

Backlash\SpecialChar ~
Compensation
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{backlash compensation}

\end_inset 

 - Any technique that attempts to reduce the effect of backlash without
 actually removing it from the mechanical system.
 This is typically done in software in the controller.
 This can correct the final resting place of the part in motion but fails
 to solve problems related to direction changes while in motion (think circular
 interpolation) and motion that is caused when external forces (think cutting
 tool pulling on the work piece) are the source of the motion.
\layout Description

Ball\SpecialChar ~
Screw
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{ball screw}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{Ballscrew}

\end_inset 

 A type of lead-screw that uses small hardened steel balls between the nut
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Ballnut}

\end_inset 

 and screw to reduce friction.
 Ball-screws have very low friction and backlash 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Backlash}

\end_inset 

, but are usually quite expensive.
\layout Description

Ball\SpecialChar ~
Nut
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{ball nut}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{Ballnut}

\end_inset 

 A special nut designed for use with a ball-screw.

 of the screw to the other.
\layout Description

CNC
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{CNC}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{CNC}

\end_inset 

 Computer Numerical Control.

\end_inset 

.
\layout Description

Coordinate\SpecialChar ~
Measuring\SpecialChar ~
Machine
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{coordinate measuring machine}

\end_inset 

 A Coordinate Measuring Machine is used to make many accurate measurements
 on parts.

 can be found, when a hand-made prototype needs to be digitized for moldmaking,
 or to check the accuracy of machined or molded parts.
 
\layout Description

DRO
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{DRO}

\end_inset 

 A Digital Read Out is a device attached to the slides of a machine tool
 or other device which has parts that move in a precise manner to indicate
 the current location of the tool with respect to some reference position.
 Nearly all DRO's use linear quadrature encoders to pick up position information
 from the machine.
 
\layout Description

EDM
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{EDM}

\end_inset 

 EDM is a method of removing metal in hard or difficult to machine or tough
 metals, or where rotating tools would not be able to produce the desired
 shape in a cost-effective manner.
 An excellent example is rectangular punch dies, where sharp internal corners
 are desired.
 Milling operations can not give sharp internal corners with finite diameter
 tools.
 A wire EDM machine can make internal corners with a radius only slightly
 larger than the wire's radius.
 A 'sinker' EDM cam make corners with a radius only slightly larger than
 the radius on the corner of the convex EDM electrode.

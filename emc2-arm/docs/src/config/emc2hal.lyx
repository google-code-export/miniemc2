Parameters
\layout Standard

Many of these parameters serve as debugging aids, and are subject to change
 or removal at any time.
\layout Description

\emph on 
motion.motion-inpos
\layout Description

motion.motion-enabled TRUE when motion is enabled
\layout Description

 meeting its timing constraints
\layout Description

motion.servo.overruns By noting large differences between successive values
 of 
\emph on

 to meet its timing constraints.
 Each time such a failure is detected, this value is incremented.

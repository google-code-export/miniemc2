Stepconf: Configure EMC2 for Step & Direction CNC Machines
\layout Standard

EMC2 is capable of controlling a wide range of machinery using many different
 hardware interfaces.
 Stepconf is a program which generates EMC configuration files for a specific
 class of CNC machine: those connected to the PC using a standard 
\series bold 
parallel port
\series default 
 and controlled with 
\series bold 
step & direction
\series default 
 signals.

Finding Maximum Velocity

\layout Standard

Begin with a low Acceleration (e.g., 2 in/s^2 or 50mm/s^2) and the velocity
 you hope to attain.
 Using the buttons provided, jog the axis to near the center of travel.
 Take care because with a low acceleration value, it can take a surprising
 distance for the axis to decelerate to a stop.
\layout Standard

After gauging the amount of travel available, enter a safe distance in Test
 Area, keeping in mind that after a stall the motor may next start to move
 in an unexpected direction.
 Then click Run.
 The machine will begin to move back and forth along this axis.
 In this test, it is important that the combination of Acceleration and
 Test Area allow the machine to reach the selected Velocity and

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for at least a short distance--the more distance, the better this test
 is.
 The formula d=.5*v*v/a gives the minimum distance required reach the specified
 velocity with the given acceleration.
 If it is convenient and safe to do so, push the table against the direction
 of motion to simulate cutting forces.
 If the machine stalls, reduce the speed and start the test again.
\layout Standard

If the machine did not obviously stall, click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Run
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 button off.
 The axis now returns to the position where it started.
 If the position is incorrect, then the axis stalled or lost steps during
 the test.
 Reduce Velocity and start the test again.
\layout Standard

If the machine doesn't move, stalls, or loses steps no matter how low you
 turn Velocity, verify the following:

Axis Travel, Home Location, and Home Switch Location
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Axis-Travel-Home}

\layout Standard

For each axis, there is a limited range of travel.
 The physical end of travel is called the 
\series bold

\series default 
.
\layout Standard

Before the 
\series bold 
hard stop
\series default 
 there is a 
\series bold 
limit switch
\series default 
.
 If the limit switch is encountered during normal operation, EMC shuts down
 the motor amplifier.
 The distance between the 
\series bold 
hard stop
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
limit switch
\series default 
 must be long enough to allow an unpowered motor to coast to a stop.
 
\layout Standard

Before the 
\series bold 
limit switch
\series default 
 there is a 
\series bold 
soft limit
\series default 
.
 This is a limit enforced in software after homing.
 If a MDI command, or gcode program would pass the soft limit, it is not
 executed.
 If a jog would pass the soft limit, it is terminated at the soft limit.
\layout Standard

The 
\series bold 
home switch
\series default 
 can be placed anywhere within the travel (between hard stops).
 As long as external hardware does not deactivate the motor amplifiers with
 the limit switch is reached, one of the limit switches can be used as a
 home switch.
\layout Standard

The 
\series bold 
zero position
\series default 
 is the location on the axis that is 0 in the machine coordinate system.
 Usually the 
\series bold

 of the homing sequence.
 This value must be within the

 In particular, the

Latency Test
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Latency-Test}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Generating step pulses in software has one very big advantage - it's free.
 Just about every PC has a parallel port that is capable of outputting step
 pulses that are generated by the software.
 However, software step pulses also have some disadvantages:
\layout Itemize

limited maximum step rate 
\layout Itemize

jitter in the generated pulses
\layout Itemize

loads the CPU
\layout Standard

Latency is how long it takes the PC to stop what it is doing and respond
 to an external request.
 In our case, the request is the periodic "heartbeat" that serves as a timing
 reference for the step pulses.
 The lower the latency, the faster you can run the heartbeat, and the faster
 and smoother the step pulses will be.
\layout Standard

Latency is far more important than CPU speed.
 A lowly Pentium II that responds to interrupts within 10 microseconds each
 and every time can give better results than the latest and fastest P4 Hyperthre
ading beast.
\layout Standard

The CPU isn't the only factor in determining latency.
 Motherboards, video cards, USB ports, and a number of other things can
 hurt the latency.
 The best way to find out what you are dealing with is to run the HAL latency
 test.
\layout Standard

To run the test, simply open a shell and type

While the test is running, you should "abuse" the computer.
 Move windows around on the screen.
 Surf the web.
 Copy some large files around on the disk.
 Play some music.
 Run an OpenGL program such as glxgears.
 The idea is to put the PC through its paces while the latency test checks
 to see what the worst case numbers are.

The important numbers are the

max jitter

.
 In the example above, that is 17894 nanoseconds, or 17.9 microseconds.
 Record this number, and enter it in Stepconf when it is requested.
\layout Standard

In the example above, latency-test only ran for a few seconds.
 You should run the test for at least several minutes; sometimes the worst
 case latency doesn't happen very often, or only happens when you do some
 particular action.
 For instance, one Intel motherboard worked pretty well most of the time,
 but every 64 seconds it had a very bad 300uS latency.
 Fortunately that was fixable (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl["Fixing Dapper SMI Issues"]{http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emcinfo.pl?FixingDapperSMIIssues}

)
\layout Standard

So, what do the results mean? If your Max Jitter number is less than about
 15-20 microseconds (15000-20000 nanoseconds), the computer should give
 very nice results with software stepping.
 If the max latency is more like 30-50 microseconds, you can still get good
 results, but your maximum step rate might be a little disappointing, especially
 if you use microstepping or have very fine pitch leadscrews.
 If the numbers are 100uS or more (100,000 nanoseconds), then the PC is
 not a good candidate for software stepping.
 Numbers over 1 millisecond (1,000,000 nanoseconds) mean the PC is not a
 good candidate for EMC, regardless of whether you use software stepping
 or not.
\layout Standard

Note that if you get high numbers, there may be ways to improve them.
 Another PC had very bad latency (several milliseconds) when using the onboard
 video.
 But a $5 used Matrox video card solved the problem - EMC does not require
 bleeding edge hardware.

Home and Limit Switch wiring options

The ideal wiring for external switches would be one input per switch.
 However, the PC parallel port only offers a total of 5 inputs, while there
 are as many as 9 switches on a 3-axis machine.
 Instead, multiple switches are wired together in various ways so that a
 smaller number of inputs are required.
\layout Standard

The figures below show the general idea of wiring multiple switches to a
 single input pin.
 In each case, when one switch is actuated, the value seen on INPUT goes
 from logic HIGH to LOW.
 However, EMC expects a TRUE value when a switch is closed, so the corresponding

Combine home switches for all axes

Combine limit switches for all axes

Combine both limit switches for one axis
\layout Itemize

Combine both limit switches and the home switch for one axis

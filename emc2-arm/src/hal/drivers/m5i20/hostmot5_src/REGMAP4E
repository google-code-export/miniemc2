CCR (Counter Control Register) Bit definitions:

BIT15	IndexMaskPol	0 = IM is active low	1 = IM is active high
BIT14	IndexMaskEnable	0 = IM is dont-care	1 = IM must be true to detect index
( bit 14 read back is real time index mask status)
BIT13	LatchOnce	if 1, clear LOI (bit 12) when index detected
BIT12	LatchOnIndex	0 = no LOI		1 = latch counter on index
BIT11	AutoCount	0 = normal operation	1 = counter counts up at PCI clk rate	
BIT10	CounterMode	0 = quadrature		1 = up/down
BIT9	QuadFilter	0 = ~11 Mhz filter	1 = ~4 MHz filter	
BIT8	LocalHold	1 = hold counter	1 = counter can count
BIT7	Indexgate	0 = index anytime	1 = index detected only when A=B=0			
BIT6	ClearOnce	if 1, clear COI (bit5) when index detected
BIT5	ClearOnIndex	0 = no COI		1 = clear counter on index
BIT4	IndexPol	0 = active low index	1 = active high index
BIT3	LatchOnRead	1 = latch on read (Transparent mode)
BIT2	LocalClear	Real time index status (reads) counter clear (writes)
BIT1	B		Real time input A status (read only)	
BIT0	A		Read time input B status (read only)

(0x58 .. 0x5F unused)

PWMVAL0		0x60
PWMVAL1		0x62
PWMVAL2		0x64
PWMVAL3		0x66

(0x78 .. 0x7F unused)

In signed mode, PWMVAL is a signed 16 bit number which is output as 
10 bit PWM plus sign on the direction bit.

In unsignedmode PWMVAL is an unsigned 16 bit number which is output as 
10 bit PWM. DIR is an input in unsigned mode.

PCR0		0x80
PCR1		0x82
PCR2		0x84
PCR3		0x86
 					
(0x98 .. 0x9F unused)

PCR bit Definitions:
BIT4		DIR bit (input if in unsigned mode)
BIT3		Realtime PWM output bit status (read only)	
BIT2		unsigned mode bit 1 = unsigned
BIT1		Interlace enable (interlaces PWM output for use as analog out)
BIT0 		Enable -- enables PWM and ENA bit if set


GContReg	0xC0

GContReg bit definitions:
BIT4		0 = NOP		1 = Reload WD timer
BIT3		0 = NOP		1 = Clear IRQ
BIT2		0 = NOP		1 = Clear all PWMs
BIT1		0 = NOP		1 = Latch all counters
BIT0		0 = NOP		1 = Clear all counters
 
Note GContReg is write only and "transient" you only need to write once to
accomplish the desired action, no need to clear the bit later...

GModeReg	0xC2

GMode register bit definitions:

BIT7	SOT		Stop on watchdog timeout control bit
BIT6	IRQstatus	Real time IRQ status
BIT5	IRQMask		IRQ mask bit
BIT4	MissedIRQ	Missed interrupt status
BIT3	SOM		Stop on Missed interrupt control bit
BIT2	LOI		Latch on interrupt control bit
BIT1	PWMEN		Global PWM enable
BIT0	CTREN		Global counter enable

IRQDivSel	0xC4

8 bit programmable divider for IRQ rate = PWM rate/(IRQDivSel+1)

RATE register	0xC6
16 bit rate register: multiplies PWM reference counter input rate by
RATE/65536 so final PWM rate = MasterClock/1024 * RATE/65536 

WDTimeOut	0xC8
R/W 16 bit watchdog timeout register, sets watchdog timeout in ~1 usec increments
(PCICLK/33) WDtimer register is loaded with this value when bit 4 of gcontreg is set

WDTimer		0xCA
R/O timer register displays ~usec until watchdog bytes

LEDView		0xCC

LED view register determines what channel the on card LEDS monitor.
The LED View register need only be written when the viewed channel is changed
LEDs monitor the following signals of the selected channel:

CR1	IRQLatch
CR2	QuadA
CR3	QuadB
CR4	IDX
CR5	DIR
CR6	PWM
CR7	ENA
CR8	WDTIMEOUT

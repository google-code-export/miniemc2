# This is the normal version, used for all EMC configs.
# These configs use a simple bus interface, with no wait
# states, interrupts, or arbitration.  Constraints for those
# pins have been removed to avoid synthesis errors.  (It is
# an error to have a constraint for a signal that is not in
# the design.)

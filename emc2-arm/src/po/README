Note for translators of the pot files:
======================================

Please make a copy of the pot file renaming it to reflect the language it is
being translated in to. For example, for a German translation of rs274_err.pot,
your working file would be de_rs274_err.po - If the file does not exist within
the CVS repository, then feel free to create one from a *.pot template:
    cp axis.pot xx_axis.pot

To update a language's .po file from its .pot file, use the "msgmerge" command.
Because doing this frequently creates lots of uneeded revisions of the
.po files in CVS, and because different translators have preferences about
msgmerge flags (particularly --width, --no-wrap, and --no-fuzzy-matching),
this is not done automatically by the "make" process.  The simplest "msgmerge"
commandline is:
    msgmerge -U xx_axis.po axis.pot

When you are done, "cvs commit" the new .po file.  If you have not yet arranged
to have "commit access", then e-mail the updated .po file to a developer or
contact the emc-developers mailing list.


Graphical tools for editing .po files
=====================================
On Dapper there seem to be two graphical front-ends for editing .po files:
gtranslator (a part of the Gnome desktop) and kbabel (part of KDE).


The different translation files
===============================
    axis.pot
	For the AXIS User Interface
    rs274_err.pot
	Error messages from the interpreter (only shown in the AXIS GUI?)
    tcl.pot
	For tkemc, mini, and other TCL/Tk programs
	The .po files are named xx.po, not xx_tcl.po


Required versions of xgettext and msgmerge
==========================================
If you see a message like
    xgettext version 0.14.1 buggy -- need at least 0.14.5
from configure, then your system has a version of xgettext that cannot properly
create .pot files from .tcl sources.  Upgrade to the named version.

If you see a message like
    checking for --tcl support in msgfmt... no
then your system has a version of msgfmt that cannot create .msg files
from .po files.  Version 0.14.5 has support for --tcl.
